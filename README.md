## License

This code is all rights reserved. This is because the code relies on [trie.js](https://gist.github.com/tpae/72e1c54471e88b689f85ad2b3940a8f0) which does not have a license. If you know of an open source trie implementation, let me know. I would love to license this codebase in the public domain.
